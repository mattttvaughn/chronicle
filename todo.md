# TODO Chronicle

## Internal

 - [ ] Update billing version by November
 - [ ] Constructor inject `Dispatchers`, remove `GlobalScope` usages (okay in Singletons?)
 - [ ] Refactor repositories to expose `StateFlow`s instead of `LiveData`?
    - [ ] Need to learn good merging techniques/extensions first
    - [ ] ViewModels too?
 - [ ] Rename callbacks in `MediaPlayerService` to be more idiomatic
 - [ ] Refactor Chapters to be managed in their own db
 - [ ] Look into `ExoPlayer.experimentalSetOffloadSchedulingEnabled`
    
## Bug fixes:

STOPSHIP:
 - [ ] 

Cannot reproduce:
 - [ ] Possible memory leaks (reported on op 6t)

Need to confirm:
 - [ ]

High priority:
 - [ ]

Medium priority: 
 - [ ] Notification doesn't get "proc"ed on chapter change
    - [ ] Temporary solution: only display track size
 - [/] issues loading huge libraries
       - [X] stopgap fix: timeout for media queries has been increased from 15s to 30s
       - [ ] real fix:
            - [ ] incremental library loading
            - [ ] optimize repository `get`s to scale better (sub n^2)
 - [ ] Playback progress in library view not updated in real-time, only on library refreshes

Low priority
 - [ ] Sleep timer "end of chapter" doesn't account for changes in playback speed
    
## High priority:

 - [X] Android Auto (feature flagged, but should be functional)
 - [ ] Casting

## Medium priority:

 - [/] Filter/Sort/`View type` UI for library
       - [/] Sort by all known fields (genre, release date, author, etc.)
             - [X] Sortable by basic fields
             - [ ] When sorting, change the grid/list item subtitle to reflect the sorted field
       - [ ] Filterable by all known Plex fields (genre, release date, author, etc.)
            - [ ] UI for this will be tricky...
       - [ ] Folder view + author view + collections view
 - [ ] Add more narrator to audiobook page: narrator
 - [ ] Better tablet/landscape support
 - [ ] Next/previous chapter buttons in "currently playing" screen?
    - [ ] At least look into improving UI for this
 - [ ] Show most recently listened book on login in bottom bar like Spotify does
 - [ ] More metadata in chapter list (start/end times or duration or something)
 - [ ] Favorites
 - [ ] Add a "last synced" at XXX warning, coupled loading data
 - [ ] Improve downloading experience
     - [ ] Show download status for tracks (progress, downloaded?)
     - [ ] Sync by disk option
     - [ ] "Download all" button?

## Low priority:

 - [ ] Support for manual server connection (no account login)
 - [ ] Handle 403s with token refresh or logout (tokens only revokable manually it seems, so not a big deal)
 - [ ] Show warning to users if they have "store track progress" disabled for library
 - [ ] Translations
 - [ ] Bookmarks + notes
 - [ ] AMOLED theme
 - [ ] Quick scroll bar
 - [ ] Widget?
